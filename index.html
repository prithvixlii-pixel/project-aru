            The artist, whose work you are looking for feels that they will never hold even a fraction of value that you hold for them. 
            He feels you will not even care enough to come back to this website ever again to look at this but he still hopes that you will and is thus leaving this here.
            <br><br>
            It is his own fault for being so intrusive and indulgent where it was never welcome.<br>
            He has been villianised, labelled irritating and an issue-bringer. Someone who's coming in between you and your happiness. But that is furthest from what is actually true.
            <br><br>
            He has no value in your story but still wishes you to have everything your heart desires and all the love in the world and then some more. He wishes for you to be happy and content.
            <br><br>
            He is not going to be an irritating presence in your life anymore who pokes you about 'texts, calls or anything else.'<br>
            Despite this, he feels knowing you has been the one of the most enriching experiences of his life and he will always cherish it.
            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight">This is a let down and consequently he has decided to Disappear Completely.</span>
