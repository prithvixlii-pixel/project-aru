    <h1>Farewell.</h1>
    <p>I do not even know if you care enough to revisit this page because I do not have the strength to do this in conversation. So this is where I will say what i want to communicate. <br>
        It is my own fault for being overly indulgent and intrusive in a place where it was not welcome.<br><br>
        I love you, but you already know that. You've known for about a year. I've been waiting for you to open your eyes and see that I was right here. And that I am more than a friend.<br>
  Thinking about you drinking coffee and a smile on your face because you are the most remarkable, maddening, challenging and frustrating person I have ever met. I love you.<br><br>
I have been villianised, labelled irritating and an issue-bringer. Someone who's coming in between you and your happiness. But that is furthest from what is actually true and how I feel.<br>
I never have to spend any kind of energy into thinking about you because you are always on my mind.<br>
But I realise i will never even come close to you ever thinking about me. You do not even see me as a 'good enough' friend to you. We're cold and distant and the conversation, whatever there is to it feels like I am forcing it.<br><br> 
So, this is me, no more forcing what cannot be. This is me, wishing you everything your heart desires, all the love there is and some more, happiness and content. <br>
I will not be an irritating presence in your life who pokes you about 'texts, calls or anything else.' <br>
Getting to know you has been one of the most enriching experiences of my life, and I will always cherish it.<br><br> 
Not to make you any more uncomfortable, but I do love you.<br>
Goodbye.</p>
